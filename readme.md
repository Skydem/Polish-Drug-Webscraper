# University project for AJiO
The project is web scrapper which collects data about polish drugs and their ingredients.

## Why?
All data are saved to json so it's easy to read data and use it to machine learning, databases which will be helpful to complete my engineering project.

## How to use
Run `app.py` file with python.

With default it will operate on short `list.json` file. If you want to use whole list, just rename the files.

Alternatively you can delete comment in `141` line to make whole list once again.
